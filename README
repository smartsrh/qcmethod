Title: Friction-example

Authors: Ellad B. Tadmor and Ronald E. Miller

Brief Description: Shearing contact between two Cu nano-asperities

Description: 

This example builds two differently-oriented Cu single crystals with asperities 
using the multiple regions feature of QC. The Cu is modeled used the Universal 3
form of the Foiles, Baskes and Daw EAM potential. The two crystals are made to 
slide past each other forcing their asperities into a sheared contact. A variety
of defect mechanisms can be observed in the asperities as they deform. This 
example is briefly described in the QC Tutorial Guide.

Installation and execution instructions:

  1. Place the Friction-example directory under $QC (where $QC is the location
     where the QC distribution is located).

  2. To make the executable:

     cd $QC/Friction-example
     make QCCOMPILER=COMP

     (Here `COMP' is the desired Fortran compiler. See QC Tutorial guide.)

  3. To run Friction-example:

     cd $QC/Friction-example/Shear
     ../fric < fric_shear.in > fric_shear.out
